# natch
In a cave in Kartoom lives a beast called the "natch" that no other hunter's been able to catch. - Dr Seuss

# Introduction
This is just a fun project for playing with prime numbers and [Ulam Spirals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral) It used React for the UI. You can access [the running version here.](https://burhop.github.io/natch)

# Supporting Work

This is an extension of [some C++ code](https://github/com/burhop/prime) I wrote for finding prime numbers.It uses the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to mark bits in a block of memory.  I then used a small Python class to process prime numbers to create an svg file of an Ulam Sprial.  

Props to [svgwrite](https://github.com/mozman/svgwrite) for providing the zoom and panning functionality.
