# natch
In a cave in Kartoom leave a beast called the "natch" that no other hunter's been able to catch. - Dr Seuss

# Introduction
This is just a fun project for playing with prime numbers and [Ulam Spirals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral) It used React for the UI.

# Supporting Work

This is an extension of [some C++ code](https://gitnub/com/burhop/prime) I wrote for finding prime numbers.  I then used a small Python class to process prime numbers to create an svg file of an Ulam Sprial.  

Props to [svgwrite](https://github.com/mozman/svgwrite) for providing the zoom and panning functionality.

This project is for calculating and storing prime numbers. It uses the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to mark bits in a block of memory. As there are an infinite number of prime numbers, this class can apply the sieve to an ever increasing list of blocks. I'm [maintaining a wiki with more information.](https://github.com/burhop/prime/wiki)
